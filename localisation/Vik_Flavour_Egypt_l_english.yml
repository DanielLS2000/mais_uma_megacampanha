 Vik_Egypt.25.t: "Well-Guided Secret"
 vik_Egypt.25.d: "It was once the Yemeni people that maintained the secret of coffee. Now, one way or another, we control the rich valleys of coffee plantations to the point we have attained a monopoly. It is our turn to maintain the secret, and ensure it stays within our borders."
 vik_Egypt.25.a: "That is fantastic."
 
 ME_Mamluks_Events.3.t: "Luxury Industry Revived"
 ME_Mamluks_Events.3.d: "In the pasts, we were a titan of luxury goods that the world would throw money hand over fist for. As our influence over the Mediterranean waivered, so did our luxury industry. Craftsmen of luxury goods have pursued other interests, and we have reverted to an agriculturally dominant economy. Now that we have a strong position, we should seek to revive our luxury industries and refurbish the workshops in our nation." 
 ME_Mamluks_Events.3.a: "Sounds Good!"
 ME_Mamluks_Events.3.b: "No, stop, reverse this!"
 
 flavor_mam.2.d: "Amidst the vibrant sands of Egypt, an opportunity emerges to reimagine a city's destiny. As the Order of Calatrava ascends to power, their stewardship over Cairo ushers in a new era of expansion and renewal. Tasked with transforming the city's very essence, you embark on a journey of "Architectural Renaissance." Guided by the principles of order, aesthetics, and progress, you orchestrate an urban symphony that expands Cairo's horizons. As streets broaden, monuments rise, and neighborhoods flourish, the city flourishes under your strategic direction. Through your transformative efforts, Cairo evolves into an emblem of grandeur and innovation, honoring its past while embracing a future illuminated by architectural marvels."
