It is in this area that the large-scale industrialization of the Italian economy took hold. Industrialization was financed by the two German-model universal banks, the Italian Commercial Bank and the Italian Credit.

With the aim of solving the problem of marshy areas, several bills followed one another in line with the liberal policies of the time, which believed that modern Piedmontese and Lombard companies would be an example to the rest of the country. The construction of a railway network was the goal that attracted the greatest financial commitment. Since malaria had slowed down the construction of railways in several places, particularly in the center-south, interest in the sanitation struggle grew beyond that the will to create employment in large uninhabited and marshy areas. In Emilio Broglio he noted that, in the Po valley, the problem of malaria was considerably reduced with simple hydraulic reclamations; while from the south of the Apennines a set of much more complex and expensive works was required, not yet feasible at the time. Mortality was much higher in central-southern Italy, making entire areas completely uninhabitable."

The Lombard invasion had definitively broken the unity created by Rome, and in the North the municipalities had given a special impetus to history, while in the South the kingdom of the Swabians, Anjou, Spain and the Bourbons had another. On the one hand, the tradition of a certain autonomy had created a bold bourgeoisie full of initiatives, and there was an economic organization similar to that of other European states, conducive to the further development of capitalism and industry. On the other, the paternal administrations of Spain and the Bourbons had created nothing: the bourgeoisie did not exist, agriculture was primitive and was not even enough to satisfy the local market; no roads, no ports, no use of the few waters that the region possessed due to its special conformation. The unification put the two parts of the peninsula in intimate contact."

The work consists of the Four Moors in bronze chained to the base of a high pedestal, above which the statue of Ferdinand I himself rises. The Grand Duke is represented with the uniform of the Order of the Knights of Santo Stefano, the institution military founded by Cosimo I de 'Medici to fight the Ottomans and the racing war in the Mediterranean Sea. The Quattro Mori however constitute the most important part of the work: the accentuated twists (borrowed from Giambologna's style) and the grimaces of pain well represent the prison condition of the subjects, which is sublimated in a set of great realism and elegance. In fact, Pietro Tacca took as a model some of the Moors imprisoned in the bathroom of the convicts, the vast prison located a short distance from the Old Fortress. The first two places on the front of the monumental complex represent a vigorous man, the younger of the others, known by the name of Morgiano and perhaps of Greek or Ionian origin, with his gaze turned towards the sky. He is paired with the old corsair on the right corner, traditionally known as Alì Melioco, of Turkish origin. The couple of rear statues were placed at the base of the monument only later. The first corsair, of North African ethnicity and known by the name of Alì Salettino (from the city of Salé), represents the vigor of mature age, still with a powerful and energetic physique. Finally, the fourth is of clear sub-Saharan African origin. "

The choice of the area on which to build this important complex fell on the Campagnola as it was difficult to access in the event of an uprising in the city, but also because it was located in a strategic position with respect to the roads and railways with Austria (it was in fact directly connected with the road to Austria and not far from the Parona railway station, located along the Brenner railway) and as it is well defended both by the Adige river and by some military fortifications (in particular by the hill forts, by the bastion of Spain and the fortifications of Porta San Giorgio)."

The concessionaire's only obligation was to pay 3 percent of the value of the minerals extracted to the treasury and to compensate the owners of the funds for the damage caused.
