 shadow_kingdom_warning_tt:1 "§YThe Emperor can rein in French states by defeating them in any war, making them a Free City, or by securing an alliance or strong relations with them.§!"
 shadow_kingdom.2.d:1 "While the Kingdom of France is still formally part of the Holy Roman Empire it has in many ways turned into a 'Shadow Kingdom', with the French states acting independently of the Emperor. The failure of successive Emperors to restore Imperial authority in the region has also left large areas under the control of states that outright reject Imperial Authority.\nBy now the question for many French states is why they should allow the Emperor any authority over their lands."
 shadow_kingdom.2.a:0 "It is time to abandon France."
 shadow_kingdom.2.b:0 "We must rein in the French."
 shadow_kingdom_emperor_gives_up_tt:1 "§YFrench nations within the HRE that have been reined in will remain in the Empire.§!\n§YFrench nations that have not been reined in will leave the Empire.§!\n\n§YThe Emperor will lose §R0.2§! Imperial Authority per province development which leaves the Empire.§!"

 shadow_kingdom.3.d:0 "Despite the Imperial resolution to rein in France, there are still French states that refuse to accept the supremacy of the Empire. [Root.GetAdjective] efforts have not been completely in vain however; those states that have been reined in will not dare defy the Empire again."
 shadow_kingdom.3.a:0 "The fate of France is decided."

 shadow_kingdom.4.d2:0 "As promised, the Emperor launched a campaign to restore Imperial authority to France. [Root.GetName] was among the states that were forced to accept the rule of the Empire, and our submission is proof that the Emperor’s word is law."
