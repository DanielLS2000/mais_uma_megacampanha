 ME_Persia_Events.19.T: "Capital for the Padishah"
 ME_Persia_Events.19.D: "With the restoration of the Persian state, we must decide on a capital for our grand empire. There are many places we could claim, ancient Parsa, the spiritual home of our ancestors, or even Isfahan, the population center of our empire. What ever the choice is, only good things will follow."
 ME_Persia_Events.19.OPT1: "Our capital will Suffice"
 ME_Persia_Events.19.OPT2: "§Y[428.GetName]§! will be our new capital"
 ME_Persia_Events.19.OPT3: "§Y[424.GetName]§! will be our new capital"
 ME_Persia_Events.19.OPT4: "§Y[429.GetName]§! will be our new capital"
 
 ME_Persia_Events.4.T: "Mediterranean Trade"
 ME_Persia_Events.4.D: "My Shah, the time has come to decide upon whom trade should be given to. Our ports are laden with goods, and the Europeans demand them for their homes. Who is best served by Persian goods?"
 ME_Persia_Events.4.OPT1: "We stand alone amidst this sea."
 ME_Persia_Events.4.OPT2: "Venice"
 ME_Persia_Events.4.OPT3: "Genoa"
 ME_Persia_Events.4.OPT4: "Iberia"
 
 ME_Persia_Events.5.T: "The Question of Priorities"
 ME_Persia_Events.5.D: "Trade is a fluctuating thing. Something that, like the world itself, is ever changing and ever evolving. As such, we must seek out the best opportunities wherever we can. However that might upset those of whom we have built a relationship with as primary trading partners. How best should we deal with this paradigm change?"
 ME_Persia_Events.5.OPT1: "We shall prioritise our old partners!"
 ME_Persia_Events.5.OPT2: "We shall remain flexible and explore new possibilities!"
 
 ME_Persia_Events.2.T: "The Old Faiths"
 ME_Persia_Events.2.D: "Persia is reborn! Under a proper Iranaian Shah, Persia has reclaimed her throne upon the world. Now comes the question for all, what faith will guide us? The faiths of old protected and guided our people for thousands of years before the Arab conquests. However the Muslim faith is well and truly entrenched within society today. Our choice must be made, and we will figure out the consequences after."
 ME_Persia_Events.2.OPT1: "The Old Faith, such as the Old Kings, will guide a restored Persian Empire."
 ME_Persia_Events.2.OPT2: "While our old faith was important, we should not be tethered to the past."
 
 ME_Persia_Events.3.T: "Expanding Qurchi corp?"
 ME_Persia_Events.3.D: "The time has come to decide. Our Qurchi are the most elite troops in the empire. Yet they still remain small, even by the standards of other Elite Corps such as the Janissaries. If we are to keep up with the rest of the world, our Elites must be expanded to a proper standing army of at least ten thousand."
 ME_Persia_Events.3.OPT1: "Yes!"
 ME_Persia_Events.3.OPT2: "No, let's rely more on other troops."

 persia_grateful_army: "Grateful Army"
 desc_persia_grateful_army: "Tribal loyalties are strong in our lands and in many ways trying to supplant these by loyalty to our state can be a futile exercise. Instead of trying to create an army like that of our Indian or Persian neighbors let us work with the system we have.

Initially formed from the Safaviyya Sufi order headed by Shayk Haydar, the group rose to prominence from its connections with other secret societies like the Khurramites and Turko-Shamanism. From then, it expanded greatly among the Turks and Tajiks, helping Shah Ismail I conquer the Aq Qoyunlu tribe across the Tigris and Eastern Persia. For the most part, their loyalty and militarism established a strong Shiite state that, while intolerant of most other Muslims, carved out and independent Persia that survived both Colonialism and Revolution."

 desc_persia_gunpowder_empires_zoroastrian: "The Jazayer, a flintlock musket, used by these infantrymen was of a much heavier calibre than their European counterparts and consequently had a greater range as well as improved accuracy. Unlike European muskets however, the jazayer was loaded using a horn rather than a paper cartridge meaning although the jazayer had the advantages of range, force of impact and accuracy, it took longer to reload than the standard European muskets of the era. One of the earliest recordings of Persian soldiers using jazayers in combat dates back to the mid-seventeenth century."
